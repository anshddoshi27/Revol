# Database Progress Tracker

## How to read this
- This document summarizes the current state of database work in this repository.
- Sections will be added as features evolve (schemas, migrations, data flows).
- Each migration will be referenced by its timestamped folder name under `infra/supabase/migrations/`.
- When scanning, start from the latest migration at the bottom of the list in chronological order.
- Notes will call out breaking changes and manual steps, if any.
