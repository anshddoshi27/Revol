Auth and tenancy

Ground rules (your clarified model)

One user = one business.

Only one login per business (the “owner” account).

No staff authentication; in real life, a receptionist would just use the owner’s credentials.

No dashboard/tenant picker – after login, the owner goes straight to their admin view.

Customers never sign in. They just fill name / phone / email when booking; that data is stored on the booking and visible in the owner’s “past bookings” view.

With that in mind, here’s the updated breakdown of what I’d do for auth & tenancy.

1. Auth style: Sessions vs JWTs
What the app actually needs

A simple, secure way for the owner to log in.

Authenticated API calls from the frontend to:

fetch bookings,

manage services/availability,

see past bookings, etc.

Public booking flow that does not require login (just form submissions).

Options

Option A – Traditional server sessions

Browser stores a session cookie.

Backend keeps a session row (user_id, expiry, etc.).

Pros:

Very easy mental model.

Easy to kill all sessions.

Cons:

More awkward if you ever want:

mobile apps,

fully decoupled API,

serverless / edge compute.

Not aligned with Supabase’s “JWT + RLS” sweet spot.

Option B – JWT-based auth (Supabase style)

On login, Supabase issues:

a short-lived access token (JWT),

a refresh token.

Frontend attaches access token to requests.

DB uses JWT + RLS to only return the current user’s data.

Pros:

Built-in with Supabase.

Works great for SPAs and APIs.

Plays perfectly with Postgres RLS for isolation.

Cons:

Token/refresh flow is conceptually more complex than just “session cookie.”

What I’d choose for Tithi

👉 JWT-based auth using Supabase Auth.

Why:

You’re already committing to Supabase and Postgres.

You still want a clean API surface & good security story.

Even though you only have one owner per business, you still have many businesses/users, so per-user isolation matters.

We can keep the mental model simple:

owner logs in → frontend gets Supabase session → calls APIs as that user.

2. Refresh strategy
Options

Option A – Long-lived single token, no refresh

Access token lives for days/weeks.

Easier, but if it leaks, attacker has a lot of time.

Option B – Short-lived access token + long-lived refresh token

Access token: 5–15 minutes.

Refresh token: 30–90 days.

Frontend silently refreshes in the background.

If you revoke the refresh token, attacker can’t keep renewing.

What I’d choose for Tithi

👉 Short-lived access tokens + longer-lived refresh tokens (Supabase default).

Why:

You get good security with almost no extra work, because Supabase already handles this pattern.

The owner’s experience is still smooth:

They stay logged in for a long time (thanks to refresh token).

If something looks wrong, we can invalidate refresh tokens (e.g., on password reset).

3. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
Why MFA slows v1

Even a basic MFA setup comes with a lot of extra surface area:

Extra flows:

Enable MFA.

Verify a 6-digit code on login.

Disable MFA.

Reset/recover if user loses their device.

Data to manage:

TOTP secrets or phone numbers.

Backup codes for recovery.

Logs of failed attempts.

Edge cases:

What happens after too many failed codes?

What if user changes their phone number?

How does support help them recover?

That’s all on top of normal login/password flows you already have to get right.

What I’d choose for Tithi

👉 Skip MFA for v1.

Tithi v1 is small-surface: one owner per business, no staff accounts, no client logins.

You can get very decent security from:

strong passwords,

short-lived access tokens,

secure Stripe integration (Stripe stores card data, not you).

In a later phase, when you want “serious security hardening,” we can:

add an mfa_methods table,

implement TOTP/email OTP,

expose it in the admin UI.

For now, it is more important to ship a working product than to build full enterprise-style auth.

4. Tenant isolation: how to separate businesses

Your reality:

Each user owns exactly one business.

No user ever needs to switch businesses.

But there are many users, each with their own data.

So “multi-tenant” for you basically means “each user must only ever see their own rows.”

Options

Option A – App-level filtering

Every query manually filters by user_id:

SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE user_id = current_user_id.

Pros:

Simple to understand.

Cons:

If you forget WHERE user_id = ... even once, you can leak data.

As features grow, this risk increases.

Option B – Postgres RLS (Row-Level Security)

Every table that belongs to an owner has user_id.

You define policies like:

USING (user_id = auth.uid())

Postgres itself refuses to return rows for other users, even if you write a bad query.

Pros:

Very strong safety net.

Designed to work with Supabase (this is their main pattern).

Cons:

Initial policy setup is an extra step.

What I’d choose for Tithi

👉 Use Postgres RLS with user_id as the isolation key.

Concrete shape:

users table (Supabase auth users).

businesses table with a user_id column (1–1).

services, availability_rules, bookings, etc. all have user_id.

RLS policy: user_id = auth.uid() on each of these tables.

This keeps your model extremely simple:

No tenant picker.

No “active tenant” concept.

Just “rows belong to user X, and Postgres will only show user X their own rows.”

5. Enforcing tenant context in code

Given the above, the “tenant context” is basically just:

“Which user is making this request?”

Since one user = one business, we do not need any extra tension around tenant IDs.

How it works

The frontend uses Supabase Auth → requests include a JWT with sub = user_id.

RLS policies use auth.uid() to get that user_id.

Each table that stores private admin data includes user_id.

Examples:

businesses: one row per user.

bookings: each booking has user_id referencing the owner.

Everything you do in code is now:

“Just query the table; RLS ensures the rows belong to the logged-in user.”

No need for:

explicit tenant headers,

active tenant switching,

complicated scoping logic.

6. Roles & staff accounts

Your clarified stance:

No staff logins, full stop.

If a receptionist needs access, they’ll just use the owner’s credentials.

Staff exist only for defining availability / performing services, not as authenticated users.

Options

Option A – Overengineering roles

Create roles, user_tenant_roles, etc. now.

Model owners and staff as separate users in auth, etc.

Pros:

Very flexible later for permissioning.

Cons:

Completely unnecessary for your current, real-world usage model.

Adds conceptual complexity without immediate payoff.

Option B – Single owner + “staff as data only”

users table: only owner accounts.

businesses table: one per user.

staff table: contains staff members for that business:

name, color, calendar, etc.

linked via user_id or business_id.

Staff never authenticate; they are just entities for availability and bookings.

What I’d choose for Tithi

👉 Option B – owner-only auth; staff are just rows, not users.

Why:

Matches exactly how you expect real users to behave.

Avoids a bunch of role/permission complexity.

Still lets you:

assign bookings to a specific staff member,

define availability by staff,

show “Staff A’s calendar” in the admin view.

So the only “role” we really care about is implicit: authenticated user = owner.

7. Session & device management

Your model:

One owner per business.

A receptionist might share the same login.

We don’t need enterprise “session dashboards” on day one.

Options

Option A – Minimal v1

Use Supabase Auth sessions as-is.

Provide:

login,

logout,

password reset.

No visible UI for “active devices.”

Option B – Fully-fledged device/session management

Table of active refresh tokens/sessions.

UI listing devices, IP, last seen.

“Log out of all other devices” button.

What I’d choose for Tithi

👉 Minimal v1, but store enough data for future improvements.

Let Supabase handle session + refresh token storage internally.

You don’t need a “devices” screen now.

If you later want to:

tighten security,

show sessions,

or support “log out everywhere,”
you can layer that on when it becomes a real need.

Final shape for auth & tenancy in Tithi v1

Putting it all together, here’s the clean, updated plan that matches your clarified app:

Auth style

Use Supabase Auth with JWTs.

One users row per owner.

Login → directly to admin view.

Refresh strategy

Short-lived access tokens + long-lived refresh tokens (Supabase default).

Owner enjoys “stay logged in” behavior without giving up too much security.

MFA

Not in v1.

Can be added later as a dedicated “security upgrade” phase.

Tenant isolation

Each important table (businesses, services, availability, bookings, etc.) gets a user_id column.

Use Postgres RLS so auth.uid() can only see its own rows.

Tenant context in code

No tenant picker; no multiple businesses per user.

Backend just trusts auth.uid() and RLS guarantees isolation.

Roles & staff

Only owners authenticate.

staff exist only as data tied to the owner’s business, for availability and bookings.

No extra role tables required.

Sessions/devices

Use Supabase’s session + refresh system.

Provide basic login/logout/password reset in UI; skip session device listing for v1.

If you want, next we can turn this into:

a short “Auth & Tenancy Spec” doc you can paste into your repo (like docs/backend/auth_and_tenancy.md), written in super clear non-coder language so you + Cursor + any engineer are all aligned.

Database Modeling
One owner = one account = one business

Only the owner can log into admin (no staff logins)

No dashboard; login → straight to admin view

Customers never sign in; they just give name / phone / email at checkout

Card is saved at booking, but no money moves until the owner clicks Completed / No-Show / Cancelled / Refund on the Past Bookings page

frontend logistics

I’ll give you:

The core entities + how they relate

Recommended enums

Table-by-table schema (with relationships, indexes, soft delete / versioning)

How RLS ties it all together

1. Core entities & relationships

With your updated reality, I’d simplify tenancy like this:

auth.users (Supabase) — the owner login.

businesses — exactly one row per user.

service_categories — group services for the catalog.

services — what customers actually book.

staff — purely “data staff,” used for availability & assignment; no auth.

availability_rules — “staff X can do service Y at these times.”

customers — name/email/phone + Stripe customer link.

bookings — the appointment itself (service + staff + time + customer).

booking_payments — how/when money moved for that booking.

policies — the editable policies for that business (no-show, cancel, refund, cash).

policy_snapshots (embedded on booking) — freeze what the customer agreed to.

gift_cards + gift_card_ledger — balances & movements.

notification_templates — what the owner configures in onboarding/admin.

notification_events — log of actual sends.

Key idea: every tenant-owned table has user_id (auth.uid) and business_id, but RLS uses user_id as the isolation key. Business is just the “bucket” under that owner.

2. Recommended enums

You can use Postgres enums or text + CHECK constraints. I’d do enums for clarity:

CREATE TYPE booking_status AS ENUM (
  'pending',      -- created, card saved, no money moved yet
  'scheduled',    -- same as pending but used if you want semantic diff
  'completed',
  'no_show',
  'cancelled',
  'refunded'
);

CREATE TYPE payment_status AS ENUM (
  'none',             -- no card saved / no payment expected
  'card_saved',       -- SetupIntent succeeded, card on file
  'charge_pending',   -- we are trying to charge
  'charged',          -- money captured
  'refunded',
  'failed'
);

CREATE TYPE money_action AS ENUM (
  'none',
  'completed_charge',   -- Completed button
  'no_show_fee',
  'cancel_fee',
  'refund'
);

CREATE TYPE notification_channel AS ENUM ('email', 'sms');
CREATE TYPE notification_category AS ENUM (
  'confirmation',
  'reminder',
  'follow_up',
  'cancellation',
  'reschedule',
  'completion'
);

CREATE TYPE notification_trigger AS ENUM (
  'booking_created',
  'booking_confirmed',
  'reminder_24h',
  'reminder_1h',
  'booking_cancelled',
  'booking_rescheduled',
  'booking_completed',
  'fee_charged',
  'refunded'
);

CREATE TYPE discount_type AS ENUM ('amount', 'percent');

(user_id, status, start_at DESC) — filter by status quickly.

(user_id, customer_id, start_at DESC) — customer history.

Why embed policy_snapshot?

Each booking keeps the exact policy text & fee values that the customer agreed to, so you never have “policy changed later” disputes.

3.9 booking_payments

Purpose: track how money moves for each booking and wire it to Stripe.

Columns

id uuid pk

user_id uuid not null

business_id uuid not null

booking_id uuid not null

status payment_status not null

application_fee_cents int — your 1% platform fee

stripe_fee_cents int

net_amount_cents int — remainder to the business

currency text default 'usd'

created_at, updated_at

Behavior:

At checkout: create row with status='card_saved', stripe_setup_intent_id set, amount_cents = final_price_cents (for reference).

When owner presses:

Completed → create new booking_payments row with money_action='completed_charge', amount_cents = final price (minus gift), status ends at 'charged'.

No-Show → new row with money_action='no_show_fee', amount_cents = no-show fee calculated from policy snapshot.

Cancelled → new row with money_action='cancel_fee', amount_cents = cancel fee.

Refund → new row with money_action='refund', amount_cents = refund amount (positive int), status='refunded'.

bookings.payment_status & bookings.last_money_action are updated as a denormalized summary for quick display.

Indexes

(user_id, booking_id)

3.11 gift_cards

Purpose: generate/store cards with balance.

Columns

percent_off numeric(5,2) — only used for percent type

expires_at timestamptz

is_active boolean default true

created_at, updated_at, deleted_at

Constraints / indexes

UNIQUE (user_id, code) — codes unique per business.

Index (user_id, code) for lookup during checkout.

${customer.name}

${service.name}

${service.duration}

${service.price}

${booking.date}

${booking.time}

${business.name}

${booking.url}

At save time, the frontend can lint for unknown ${…} patterns; backend at send time fills them from bookings, customers, services, businesses.

Indexes

3.14 notification_events

Purpose: log sends for debugging/support.

Columns

id uuid pk

error_message text

sent_at timestamptz

created_at

Indexes

(user_id, booking_id)

(user_id, to_address, created_at DESC)

4. RLS, soft delete, and indexes (strategy)
RLS pattern (Supabase)

On every tenant-owned table, do:

Add user_id uuid not null.

Policy:

ALTER TABLE services ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "user_owns_row" ON services
USING (
  user_id = auth.uid()
  AND deleted_at IS NULL  -- when applicable
);


Same pattern for businesses, staff, availability_rules, customers, bookings, booking_payments, gift_cards, notification_templates, etc.

This keeps your mental model super simple:

“If auth.uid() doesn’t match row.user_id, Postgres won’t show you the row, even if your query is wrong.”

Given your “one user = one business” rule, you do not need separate tenant IDs or business pickers to enforce isolation.

Soft delete

For most configuration tables (services, staff, categories, gift cards, notification templates):

Add deleted_at timestamptz.

Treat deleted_at IS NOT NULL as hidden from normal queries.

Only allow “hard delete” for truly destructive actions (like business offboarding).

For bookings, I’d avoid soft delete entirely except for GDPR/account deletion; usually you never delete bookings, you just mark statuses.

Index strategy summary

Always index user_id on every multi-row table (fast RLS scans).

Time-series tables:

bookings(user_id, start_at DESC)

booking_payments(user_id, created_at DESC)

notification_events(user_id, created_at DESC)

Lookups:

customers(user_id, email), (user_id, phone)

gift_cards(user_id, code)

Availability:

availability_rules(user_id, service_id, staff_id, weekday)

Policies:

policies(user_id, business_id, is_active, version DESC)

This gives you fast queries that match your actual UI:

Past bookings paginated by date.

Search bookings by status & date.

Look up customers by email/phone.

Apply gift cards in checkout.

Generate slots by service/staff/day.

What you should actually do next

Lock in this simplified tenant model

Add user_id + RLS to all tables.

Enforce UNIQUE (user_id) on businesses.

Create the core tables in Supabase in roughly this order:

businesses, service_categories, services

staff, staff_services, availability_rules

customers, bookings, booking_payments

policies, gift_cards, gift_card_ledger

notification_templates, notification_events

Wire onboarding → these tables exactly in the order of your 8 steps.

Wire booking flow:

Use services + availability_rules to build slots.

On checkout: create customer, booking, booking_payments (card saved), embed policy_snapshot.

Wire the Past Bookings page:

List from bookings ordered by start_at DESC, joined to customers, services, staff, booking_payments.

Buttons call endpoints that create new booking_payments rows and update bookings.status + payment_status.

-------------
Stripe & billing specifics
Yes — Stripe Connect absolutely can power the payments in your booking flow, and the way we’ve set things up is specifically to make that work.

Let me spell out how it fits together in Tithi with your current design.

1. What “Stripe Connect powers their booking payments” actually means

For each business on Tithi, you will:

Create a Stripe Connect account for them during onboarding.

Store that as businesses.stripe_connect_account_id.

Then, in the public booking flow when a client books:

Tithi (your platform Stripe account) creates a SetupIntent or PaymentMethod for that client’s card.

When the owner later clicks Completed / No-show / Cancel (fee) on the money board, you create a PaymentIntent that:

Runs under your platform Stripe account,

But uses the connected account as the destination for funds.

So the business isn’t managing Stripe manually — Tithi is the app, Stripe is the rail.

Yes, that is exactly how Stripe Connect is meant to be used for multi-tenant SaaS platforms.

2. How this works step-by-step in your booking flow

Using the schema we designed:

During onboarding

You send them through Stripe’s Connect onboarding (hosted flow).

When Stripe finishes, you save:

businesses.stripe_connect_account_id = 'acct_...'

Now Tithi knows:

“For this business, all payments should route through this connected Stripe account.”

During client booking (no money yet)

On your public booking page:

Customer picks service, time, etc.

You:

Create/find a customers row in your DB.

Create a bookings row with:

price_cents = base service price

final_price_cents = base minus any gift card/discount

Create a Stripe SetupIntent to save the card:

You can attach it to a Stripe Customer that represents this client for that business.

Store in booking_payments:

stripe_setup_intent_id

payment_status = 'card_saved'

amount_cents = final_price_cents (reference)

At this point:

Payment is not charged.

Card is ready to be charged later when the owner decides what to do.

This matches your requirement: “money moves only when the owner clicks a button on the Past Bookings / money board.”

When the owner clicks a button in the admin money board

Say the owner hits Completed on a booking.

Backend:

Looks up:

the booking,

its final_price_cents,

the associated stripe_setup_intent_id / PaymentMethod.

Creates a PaymentIntent using:

amount = final_price_cents

currency = 'usd'

customer = the Stripe customer for that client

payment_method = saved card

Connect-specific fields:

on_behalf_of = business.stripe_connect_account_id

transfer_data[destination] = business.stripe_connect_account_id

application_fee_amount = platform_fee_cents (your 1%)

Confirms the PaymentIntent.

Writes a new booking_payments row:

booking_id = ...

stripe_payment_intent_id = 'pi_...'

amount_cents = final_price_cents

money_action = 'completed_charge'

status = 'charged'

application_fee_cents, stripe_fee_cents, net_amount_cents

Updates bookings:

status = 'completed'

payment_status = 'charged'

last_money_action = 'completed_charge'

Result:

Client’s card is charged via Stripe.

Business gets paid into their connected Stripe account.

You collect your platform fee automatically.

All of this is triggered from your booking flow + money board, no separate Stripe UI needed.

The exact same pattern works for:

No-show fee → PaymentIntent with amount_cents = calculated no-show fee from policy_snapshot.

Cancel fee → same idea.

Refund → create a Stripe refund for the original PaymentIntent and log it in booking_payments as money_action = 'refund'.

3. Does this truly “let them use Stripe to power their payments page”?

Yes, in practice that means:

The public booking flow on Tithi:

Collects card details securely using Stripe elements or similar.

Saves the card and then charges it later.

The business owner:

Never has to configure Stripe manually outside onboarding.

Has all payments tied to their account so money goes to them, not you.

You:

Are compliant with Stripe’s Connect platform model.

Take a clean per-transaction fee without manually moving money.

As long as:

Each business has a valid stripe_connect_account_id, and

Your payment code always uses that when creating PaymentIntents,

…then Stripe Connect is powering their booking payments exactly the way you want.

If you want, I can next sketch the exact fields you should store for Stripe per business and per booking (including where to put stripe_customer_id, default payment method, etc.) so you have a concrete implementation checklist.
Alright, here’s the “Stripe wiring spec” so you can literally see what to store where and how it all ties into your booking flow + Connect.

I’ll break it into:

Fields to store per business

Fields to store per customer

Fields to store per booking

Fields to store per booking_payment

Optional but nice-to-have fields

Implementation checklist by flow

1. Stripe fields on businesses (owner-level)

These are about the owner’s Stripe Connect account + subscription.

Add to businesses:

stripe_connect_account_id text

The ID from Connect onboarding, e.g. acct_123.

Used in every PaymentIntent: on_behalf_of + transfer_data[destination].

stripe_customer_id text (optional but useful)

A Stripe Customer representing the business owner themselves, if you bill them (e.g., subscriptions directly).

Not required if you only use Stripe Billing with your own customer records, but nice if you charge them “off-session”.

stripe_subscription_id text

The subscription for Tithi’s $11.99/mo plan.

Created during onboarding when they enter their own card for Tithi.

stripe_price_id text

The price ID for your plan (e.g., price_abc123).

Not strictly required per business if it’s constant in code, but helpful if you ever support multiple plans.

stripe_default_payment_method_id text (optional)

The payment method you use to bill them for your SaaS fee.

Can also be fetched from the subscription in Stripe instead of storing here, but caching it is convenient.

These fields let you:

Know which Connect account to send booking revenue to.

Know how you bill the business owner for your platform fee (subscription).

2. Stripe fields on customers (client-level)

These are about clients who book appointments, not the owner.

Add to customers:

stripe_customer_id text

One Stripe Customer per (Tithi-)customer per business.

Lets you save multiple PaymentMethods (cards) for that client.

Used when creating SetupIntents and PaymentIntents.

You don’t need to store payment methods per customer in your DB; you can fetch them from Stripe when needed. But if you want to pin a default:

stripe_default_payment_method_id text (optional)

If you want “preferred card” behavior.

3. Stripe fields on bookings (appointment-level)

Keep bookings Stripe-related fields minimal. The heavy Stripe detail lives in booking_payments.

You already have:

price_cents int — base price

final_price_cents int — after gift card/discount

gift_card_id uuid

gift_card_amount_applied_cents int

payment_status payment_status

last_money_action money_action

You don’t need SetupIntent/PaymentIntent directly on bookings, because those belong in booking_payments. That keeps the booking “clean”: it knows what should be charged, not all the Stripe plumbing.

So for bookings, you’re good with:

Amounts: price_cents, final_price_cents

Discount source: gift_card_*

Summary state: payment_status, last_money_action

4. Stripe fields on booking_payments (money-level)

This is where we store every Stripe object tied to a booking + why it exists.

On booking_payments:

stripe_setup_intent_id text

The SetupIntent used to save the card at checkout.

Usually created at booking time (public flow).

Only one is typically needed, but you might recreate in some edge cases.

stripe_payment_intent_id text

The PaymentIntent for this specific money event:

Completed charge

No-show fee

Cancellation fee

Refund

stripe_refund_id text (optional but nice)

If this row corresponds to a refund, store the Stripe Refund ID.

amount_cents int not null

The amount of this transaction (positive int).

For refunds, still store as positive int and use money_action = 'refund' to indicate direction.

money_action money_action not null

'completed_charge' | 'no_show_fee' | 'cancel_fee' | 'refund' | ...

status payment_status not null

'card_saved' | 'charge_pending' | 'charged' | 'refunded' | 'failed' etc.

application_fee_cents int

The fee you took as platform (e.g., 1% of amount_cents).

stripe_fee_cents int

The fee Stripe took (you can fetch from Stripe’s balance transaction, or leave null if you don’t care initially).

net_amount_cents int

Money that actually went to the business (amount - fees).

currency text default 'usd'

These fields make it trivial to:

Reconcile with Stripe’s dashboard.

Show “Money timeline” per booking.

Know exactly what was charged/refunded and why.

5. Optional extra fields (only if you want them)

On booking_payments:

stripe_payment_method_id text

If you need to know exactly which card was used for a given charge.

Not strictly needed if you just look it up in Stripe using the PaymentIntent.

On gift_cards:

stripe_payment_intent_id text

If you sell gift cards via Stripe (clients pay to buy a card).

Lets you tie gift card purchase revenue to the right Stripe charge.

These are nice for deeper analytics / support, but not mandatory for a solid v1.

6. Implementation checklist by flow

Here’s the concrete “do this in code” flow, now that fields are settled.

A. Business onboarding (owner signup → live account)

Owner signs up → only auth.users exists.

Onboarding steps gather:

Business info

Branding

Categories + services

Staff

Availability

Policies

Stripe Connect onboarding:

Create / connect Stripe account → get connect_account_id.

Save to draft or hold in memory until final commit.

Stripe subscription for Tithi:

Create Stripe Customer for business owner (if needed).

Create Subscription using stripe_price_id.

Save:

stripe_customer_id

stripe_subscription_id

stripe_default_payment_method_id (optional)

Final onboarding step:

In a transaction:

Create businesses row with:

user_id

stripe_connect_account_id

stripe_customer_id / stripe_subscription_id

all business details

Insert:

service_categories

services

staff + staff_services

availability_rules

policies

notification_templates

Show confetti screen:

“Business is live”

Booking URL (from subdomain)

Button → Admin view.

B. Client booking flow (public page, card saved only)

Client picks service, date/time, staff (or “any”).

Backend:

Create/find customers row for this business:

If no stripe_customer_id yet:

Create Stripe Customer under your platform.

Save customers.stripe_customer_id.

Create a SetupIntent:

customer = customers.stripe_customer_id

payment_method_types = ['card']

usage = 'off_session' (since you’re going to charge later).

Frontend:

Use Stripe Elements to collect card.

Confirm SetupIntent, get success.

Backend:

Create bookings row:

price_cents from services.price_cents

final_price_cents after gift card

gift_card_* fields if used

policy_snapshot from current policies

status = 'pending'

payment_status = 'card_saved'

Create booking_payments row:

stripe_setup_intent_id

amount_cents = final_price_cents

money_action = 'none'

status = 'card_saved'

Now you’re in your comfortable state: booking exists, card saved, no money moved.

C. Admin money board actions (charge/refund)
1. Completed

When owner clicks Completed on a booking card:

Backend fetches:

booking (to get final_price_cents, customer_id, business_id)

business.stripe_connect_account_id

customers.stripe_customer_id

Payment method from Stripe (using SetupIntent or saved default).

Create a PaymentIntent on your platform account:

amount = booking.final_price_cents

currency = 'usd'

customer = customers.stripe_customer_id

payment_method = <from SetupIntent>

confirm = true

on_behalf_of = business.stripe_connect_account_id

transfer_data[destination] = business.stripe_connect_account_id

application_fee_amount = platform_fee_cents

On success:

Create booking_payments row:

stripe_payment_intent_id

amount_cents = final_price_cents

money_action = 'completed_charge'

status = 'charged'

Update bookings:

status = 'completed'

payment_status = 'charged'

last_money_action = 'completed_charge'

Same exact pattern, different money_action and amount for:

No-show fee:

Amount comes from policy_snapshot.no_show_fee_*.

money_action = 'no_show_fee'.

Cancellation fee:

Amount comes from policy_snapshot.cancel_fee_*.

money_action = 'cancel_fee'.

2. Refund

When owner hits Refund:

Look up the original booking_payments row (with status = 'charged').

Call Stripe refunds.create({ payment_intent: 'pi_...' }).

Insert a new booking_payments row:

stripe_refund_id

amount_cents = refunded amount

money_action = 'refund'

status = 'refunded'

Update bookings:

status = 'refunded' (or keep completed but with payment_status = 'refunded', depending on your UX).

payment_status = 'refunded'

last_money_action = 'refund'

That’s the full Stripe wiring:

Where each ID lives.

Which tables care about Stripe.

How Connect powers payments in your booking flow.

How that meshes with your onboarding + money board design.

If you want, next I can write the actual Supabase table definitions (SQL) for customers and booking_payments with these Stripe fields baked in, plus a sample query the admin view would run to render the money board cards.

1. Stripe & billing specifics — what to use

What I think you should do

Use Stripe Billing for the $11.99/month Tithi subscription (per business).

Use Stripe Connect (Express) for appointment payments going to the business.

Use SetupIntents + PaymentMethods at checkout to save the customer’s card.

Use PaymentIntents only when the owner hits:

Completed

No-Show

Cancelled

Refund

Why this fits Tithi

You’ve already defined that no money moves at checkout – card is just “saved securely” and charges only happen when the owner clicks a button in Past Bookings. 

frontend logistics

That maps perfectly to SetupIntent now, PaymentIntent later.

Billing vs. appointments:

Tithi’s own revenue (11.99/month) is just a normal Stripe Billing subscription on the platform account.

Customer appointments are destination charges to the connected account (the business) with a 1% application fee back to you, exactly like you described. 

frontend logistics

With your updated rule “one owner can only have one business”, you can keep it simple:

1 users row ↔ 1 business row ↔ 1 Stripe Connect account ↔ 1 platform subscription.

So concretely:

Platform side

1 Stripe Product: tithi_monthly

1 Stripe Price: $11.99 / month

Owner finishes onboarding → you start that subscription.

Business side (appointments)

For each business you store:

stripe_connect_account_id

Every booking charge uses:

payment_intent.on_behalf_of = stripe_connect_account_id

transfer_data[destination] = stripe_connect_account_id

application_fee_amount = round(0.01 * charge_amount_in_cents)

2. Source-of-truth for payment flows

(manual capture vs deposit vs card-on-file)

What I think you should choose for v1

👉 Pick a single strategy: “card-on-file then charge later” (no manual capture auth, no deposits in v1).

More specifically:

At checkout (customer):

Compute a single final_price for the booking (base service price minus any gift card/discount). 

frontend logistics

Create a Stripe Customer for this person (per business).

Create a SetupIntent and confirm it to save the card.

Create a booking row with:

status = pending

stripe_customer_id

stripe_setup_intent_id

final_price_cents

No PaymentIntent here. No charge yet.

When owner clicks a money button in Past Bookings:

Completed → create a PaymentIntent for final_price_cents using the saved card (off-session).

No-Show → create a PaymentIntent for the no-show fee, calculated from the stored policy snapshot.

Cancelled → create a PaymentIntent for the cancellation fee (often 0, then it’s just a status change).

Refund → create a refund if there is an actual charge.

Each PaymentIntent uses:

on_behalf_of + transfer_data[destination] = business Connect account

application_fee_amount = 1% of amount (your platform cut)

Why this is the best fit

Your UX says “Customers see: card is stored, you’re not charged now, you’ll be charged after your appointment or if a fee applies” – that is exactly a SetupIntent-only booking with off-session charges later. 

frontend logistics

Manual capture flows (auth → capture) introduce:

7-day auth windows

Edge cases when auth expires

More complexity than you need for v1.

Deposit flows add more decisions (how big, when to charge remainder, what happens on no-show) that you do not need before you launch.

So: make “card-on-file then charge via buttons” the canonical, single source-of-truth for your payment flow. You can always layer “deposit” or “auth at booking” later if you want advanced knobs.

3. Connect account creation path, subscription IDs, webhooks, idempotency
a) Connect account creation path

Flow I’d use:

Owner goes through onboarding.

On the Payment Setup step:

Backend:

Creates a Stripe Customer for the owner (on the platform account).

Creates a Stripe Connect Express account for their business.

Generates an Account Link URL for Stripe onboarding.

Frontend:

Redirects the owner to Stripe Express onboarding.

When they return to Tithi via refresh_url:

Backend checks the Connect account is details_submitted = true.

Then creates a Stripe Billing subscription for that owner’s card:

Product = tithi_monthly

Price = 11.99/mo

Save:

stripe_connect_account_id

stripe_customer_id

stripe_subscription_id

Only once both are done:

Mark business as live.

Show the “Go Live” confirmation, booking URL, and drop them into admin. 

frontend logistics

Because you only allow one business per owner, you can keep it very strict: no “pick which business to open,” no business switcher.

b) Subscription product/price IDs

In your backend config (env or constants), define:

TITHI_PLAN_PRODUCT_ID = "prod_xxx"

TITHI_PLAN_PRICE_ID = "price_xxx"

Every time you need to create a subscription, you always use TITHI_PLAN_PRICE_ID and never hard-code amounts in code.

Store per business:

stripe_subscription_id

subscription_status (trial, active, paused, canceled)

next_bill_at

This maps cleanly to the “Trial, Active, Paused, Canceled” states you wrote into the frontend logistics. 

frontend logistics

c) Webhook events to handle

For v1, I’d handle:

Platform billing side (your subscription):

customer.subscription.updated

Update subscription_status and next_bill_at.

If status becomes canceled, mark business as canceled and deprovision the subdomain (like you specified).

invoice.payment_succeeded

Mark invoice as paid; maybe log usage/analytics.

invoice.payment_failed

Mark business as past_due or show a banner in admin.

Appointment payments side (Connect):

payment_intent.succeeded

Mark the booking payment as captured (or fee_charged).

Update booking status: completed, no_show_fee_charged, etc.

Trigger “receipt” and “booking completed/fee charged” notifications.

payment_intent.payment_failed

Mark booking payment as failed.

Show “Payment issue” on the booking card and allow Send Pay Link.

charge.refunded

Mark booking as refunded and update your ledger.

charge.dispute.created

Flag booking as disputed, show in admin with a link to Stripe.

setup_intent.succeeded

Confirm that the card is saved for that booking’s customer.

You can start with these and expand later; they cover 95% of what Tithi actually needs.

d) Idempotency requirements

What I’d do:

For all “money board” actions (Completed, No-Show, Cancelled, Refund):

Frontend generates a UUID as idempotencyKey.

Sends to backend header: X-Idempotency-Key: <uuid>.

Backend:

Checks if that key has been used for this booking+action.

If not, stores it and calls Stripe with the same idempotency key.

If yes, returns the previously saved result and does not create a second charge.

Also store stripe_payment_intent_id / stripe_refund_id per booking payment record so you can prove what happened.

This matches what your UX wants:

Buttons disable + show spinner after click.

Double-clicks or retrying the same API call cannot double-charge. 

frontend logistics

4. Policy fee math & invoices/receipts
a) How to model policy fees (flat vs percent)

Based on your policies step: 

frontend logistics

For each business, store:

no_show_fee_type = 'flat' | 'percent'

no_show_fee_value

cancel_fee_type = 'flat' | 'percent'

cancel_fee_value

And at booking time you snapshot:

no_show_fee_type_at_booking

no_show_fee_value_at_booking

cancel_fee_type_at_booking

cancel_fee_value_at_booking

policy_text_hash (a hash of their written policy text)

So if they change their policy later, old bookings still follow what the customer actually agreed to.

Calculation example:

base_price_cents (after gift card/discount is applied).

If no-show:

If type = flat → fee_cents = value_cents.

If type = percent → fee_cents = round(base_price_cents * value / 100).

For cancellations, same logic.

Then you create a PaymentIntent with amount = fee_cents.

b) Invoices & receipts

You do not need a full internal invoice system right now. I’d do:

Let Stripe send the official receipt email to the customer.

In Tithi, store simple payment records per booking:

booking_id

type = completed_charge, no_show_fee, cancel_fee, refund

amount_gross_cents

discount_cents (from gift card)

platform_fee_cents (1%)

stripe_fee_cents (estimate or webhook value)

amount_net_to_business_cents

stripe_payment_intent_id / stripe_refund_id

receipt_url (from Stripe, if available)

The Past Bookings “details” view can show a mini “receipt/ledger” with:

Service name

Base price

Gift card discount

No-show / cancel fee if applicable

Platform fee

Stripe fee

Net to business

This gives owners the transparency you described (gross → fees → net) without you building a full invoice engine.

TL;DR choices for Tithi

Stripe & billing:

Stripe Billing for $11.99/month subscription per business.

Stripe Connect Express per business.

SetupIntents to save cards; PaymentIntents only on admin actions.

Payment source-of-truth:

Single v1 strategy = card-on-file + off-session charge when owner clicks (no manual capture, no deposit flows yet).

Connect path & tooling:

Create Connect + Customer + Subscription on Payment Setup step.

Handle webhooks for subscriptions + payments.

Use strict idempotency for every money button.

Policy fee & receipts:

Model no-show/cancel as flat/percent, snapshot per booking, compute fee from final_price.

Let Stripe send receipts; store a lean payments ledger & show breakdown in Past Bookings.

If you want, next step I can:

turn this into a concrete Stripe integration checklist (endpoint list + exact objects per step) tailored to your Supabase/Flask stack so you can just hand it to Cursor or start coding against it.


---------------

API Contracts
0. Ground rules I’m locking in for your build

I’m treating these as non-negotiable:

One owner account → one business. No multi-business switcher (you can keep the schema future-proof, but UX is single-business).

Only the owner can log in. No staff accounts, no staff roles for auth. Staff exist only to map availability and show in booking UI.

When owner logs in → go straight to Admin (overview mirroring onboarding). No dashboard screen.

Customers never sign in. They only give name, email, phone at checkout.

Card is saved at booking (SetupIntent), charged later only when the owner hits:
Completed / No-Show / Cancelled / Refund on Past Bookings.

You do want Past Bookings in the admin, but you do not need “orders” or a customer account history UI.

Keep RLS (Row Level Security) if you’re already heading that way; just treat business_id = tenant_id even though you’re only allowing one per user right now. That keeps you safe and future-proof.

1. API contracts – what you actually need (and nothing extra)

You do not need the huge enterprise API surface in the spec. For your v1 Tithi with one business per owner, I’d implement just these groups:

1.1 Auth & owner

POST /auth/signup

Body: { email, password, first_name, last_name }

Creates user + “empty” business onboarding context.

Response: { access_token, owner: { id, email, name } }

POST /auth/login

Body: { email, password }

Response: { access_token, owner: { id, email, name }, business: { id, status } }

Frontend then immediately routes to /app/b/{businessId} (admin).

Status codes:

200 success

400 validation

401 wrong credentials
Errors format:

{ "error": { "code": "INVALID_CREDENTIALS", "message": "Email or password is incorrect." } }

1.2 Onboarding/admin sections (mirror each tab)

Use one sectioned endpoint instead of a million tiny ones:

PUT /business/onboarding/step-1-business

PUT /business/onboarding/step-2-branding

PUT /business/onboarding/step-3-services

PUT /business/onboarding/step-4-availability

PUT /business/onboarding/step-5-notifications

PUT /business/onboarding/step-6-policies

PUT /business/onboarding/step-7-gift-cards

POST /business/onboarding/step-8-payment-setup

Each body is roughly the exact JSON your forms already hold: business name, subdomain, staff list, categories, services, availability grid, notification templates, policies, gift card configs, etc. (All of that is already laid out in the logistics file; just mirror it 1:1.) 

frontend logistics

Admin uses the same endpoints to edit later (same shapes, just overwriting existing data).

Status codes: 200 on success, 400 on validation, 409 for conflicts (e.g. subdomain taken).

1.3 Public booking & checkout

GET /public/{subdomain}/catalog

Returns business header + categories → services (with prices, durations, descriptions, instructions) + staff summaries.

GET /public/{subdomain}/availability?service_id=...&date=YYYY-MM-DD

Returns slots as:
[{ staff_id, staff_name, start_at, end_at }] — already filtered to that service and business timezone.

POST /public/{subdomain}/bookings

Body:

{
  "service_id": "svc_123",
  "staff_id": "stf_123",
  "start_at": "2025-11-16T14:00:00Z",
  "customer": { "name": "Aksh", "email": "x@y.com", "phone": "..." },
  "gift_card_code": "WINTER20"
}


Backend responsibilities in this one call:

Validate slot still free.

Validate gift card & compute final_price.

Create booking row (status = pending, holds final_price, policy snapshot, customer info).

Create Stripe Customer if needed.

Create SetupIntent to save card.

Return { booking_id, booking_code, client_secret_for_setup_intent }.

Frontend then uses the client secret with Stripe Elements to collect card and confirm the SetupIntent.

No PaymentIntent here. You are just saving the card.

1.4 Money board actions (admin Past Bookings)

Four simple endpoints, one per button:

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/complete

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/no-show

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/cancel

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/refund

Each:

Requires header X-Idempotency-Key (details in next section).

Backend:

Looks up booking (business-scoped via RLS).

Calculates the correct amount:

Complete → full final_price.

No-Show → no_show_fee (0 allowed).

Cancel → cancellation_fee (0 allowed).

Refund → amount of previous charge (full for v1).

Creates a PaymentIntent (or Refund) on behalf of the business’s Connect account.

Updates booking status + a payment record.

Returns:

{
  "status": "CHARGED",
  "charge_amount": 8900,
  "currency": "usd",
  "stripe_payment_intent_id": "pi_xxx",
  "receipt_url": "https://..."
}

1.5 Past bookings list

GET /admin/bookings?status=&from=&to=&page_token=

Returns:

{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "bkg_123",
      "code": "TITHI-2095",
      "status": "pending",
      "service": { "name": "Haircut", "duration_min": 45, "price_cents": 8900 },
      "staff": { "name": "Jess" },
      "start_at": "2025-11-20T15:00:00Z",
      "customer": { "name": "Aksh", "email": "x@y.com", "phone": "..." },
      "final_price_cents": 7120,
      "gift_discount_cents": 1780,
      "last_payment_status": "none|charged|refunded"
    }
  ],
  "next_page_token": "abc123"
}


Filtering: status (pending/completed/no_show/canceled/refunded), from, to.
Pagination: next_page_token cursor.

2. Idempotency, pagination, filtering, rate limits – what to do
2.1 Idempotency: only where money or bookings are created

Use an X-Idempotency-Key header on just these:

POST /public/{subdomain}/bookings

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/complete

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/no-show

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/cancel

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/refund

Backend logic:

Store a small idempotency_keys table:
id, owner_id, route, key, response_json, created_at.

On request:

If (owner_id, route, key) exists → return the stored response instead of executing again.

Else → run normally, then save response_json and key.

Why: if the owner double-clicks a money button or their browser retries, no double charges.

No need for idempotency on every little PUT /business/onboarding/...—worst case those just overwrite the same data.

2.2 Pagination & filtering

You only need pagination on:

GET /admin/bookings

(optionally) GET /admin/customers if you add a customers list.

Use cursor-based:

Request: ?limit=20&cursor=abc123

Response: next_page_token which the frontend passes back as cursor.

Filtering:

Simple: status, from, to, staff_id, service_id.

Don’t overcomplicate v1; a few query params is enough.

2.3 Rate limits

Where it matters:

Public availability & booking endpoints:

e.g. limit by IP: 60 requests / minute for availability; 10 bookings / minute.

Admin money actions:

30 requests / minute per owner (realistically they hit a few per minute at most).

Rate limiting protects you from abuse, not typically legit customers.

3. Booking creation + payment authorization: what you should do

Your product decision is actually clear:

Do not authorize any money at booking time.
Save the card, charge only when the business hits a money button.

So the answer to “should booking creation and payment authorization be one transaction?” is:

There is NO payment authorization at booking time.

The only thing you do at booking is:

Create booking row.

Save card with a SetupIntent.

Real charges happen later, per admin action, via separate PaymentIntents.

You still want booking creation + SetupIntent to behave atomically from the user’s perspective:

Recommended flow:

Customer fills checkout form.

Frontend calls POST /public/{subdomain}/bookings with booking data (no card details yet).

Backend:

Validates everything.

Creates booking row status pending.

Creates customer in Stripe (or reuses).

Creates SetupIntent with that customer.

Returns client_secret for SetupIntent + booking_id.

Frontend uses Stripe Elements to confirm SetupIntent.

If SetupIntent fails (card declined / 3DS fail):

Frontend shows error, allows retry.

You keep the booking as pending_no_card or delete it after a timeout. Either way, the user never sees “confirmed” unless the SetupIntent succeeds.

On success:

Either Stripe webhook or the front-end callback tells your backend to mark booking.card_status = "saved" (still no charge).

Show the “Booking received – card saved, no charge yet” confirmation screen.

So: no single DB transaction with money involved, just a clean, two-phase app flow:
booking + save card now; charge later when admin decides what actually happened.

4. RLS, roles, and “one business per user”: what you should do

Given your simplifications, I’d do:

users table (owner only).

businesses table with owner_id FK and a unique constraint UNIQUE(owner_id) to enforce one business per owner.

Everywhere else, rows have business_id and RLS checks business_id in (SELECT business_id FROM businesses WHERE owner_id = current_user_id).

That keeps:

Strict isolation between businesses.

Compatible with a future “multiple businesses per owner” if you ever want it (just drop that unique constraint and adjust UX).

No staff logins at all:

staff table exists purely for availability/labeling.

They never get user accounts; the receptionist uses the owner’s login, as you specified.



---------
Notifications and Availability Engine

1. Notifications
1.1. Template storage format & placeholders

What to do

Store each template in a notification_templates table:

id

owner_id (or business_id)

name (internal label, e.g. “Booking Confirmation”)

channel (email | sms)

trigger (BOOKING_CREATED, REMINDER_24H, etc.)

subject (nullable, email only)

body_markdown (or body_text)

enabled (bool)

created_at, updated_at

Use simple mustache-style placeholders, e.g.:

{{customer_name}}

{{service_name}}

{{service_duration}}

{{service_price}}

{{booking_date}}

{{booking_time}}

{{business_name}}

{{booking_url}}

Keep a hard-coded catalog of allowed placeholders per trigger in the backend and expose that catalog to the UI so the editor can show “available placeholders” like your spec says. 

frontend logistics

Rendering rule: when sending, you:

Look up the template for that business + trigger + channel.

Build a dictionary of values from the booking/business/customer.

Run a very simple template engine: replace("{{customer_name}}", actual_value) etc.

Why this is the right move

It matches your UX (owners can drop placeholders into templates).

It’s simple enough to implement in any backend (Python/Node/Supabase edge function) without bringing in a heavy templating engine.

It keeps all “how to format text” decisions in the DB, so you can change copy without redeploying.

1.2. Channels & providers (v1)

What to do

Support in v1:

Email via SendGrid (or any SMTP wrapper).

SMS via Twilio.

Model channel as a simple enum and behind the scenes have a “notifications service” that dispatches:

send_email(template, to_email, subject, body)

send_sms(template, to_phone, body)

Don’t build push in v1; wire the database and API so you can add it later.

Why

It’s enough to ship your required flows (confirmation, reminders, no-show/fee receipts).

You don’t tie yourself to a specific vendor at the DB level; you just pick one now for implementation.

1.3. Event triggers

What to do

Support these core triggers now (they map perfectly to your flows): 

frontend logistics

BOOKING_CREATED (after checkout, card saved, no charge yet)

BOOKING_CONFIRMED (if you ever separate “created” and “confirmed” states)

REMINDER_24H

REMINDER_1H

BOOKING_CANCELLED

BOOKING_RESCHEDULED

BOOKING_COMPLETED (receipt)

FEE_CHARGED (no-show / cancellation fee)

PAYMENT_ISSUE (off-session charge failed; send pay link)

Internally, you have a simple event bus:

When something happens in the booking system, you emit an event like:

{
  "type": "BOOKING_CREATED",
  "booking_id": "...",
  "business_id": "...",
  "occurred_at": "..."
}


A background worker consumes events, looks up the relevant templates for that business + trigger, merges placeholders, and dispatches via email/SMS.

Why

You keep business logic simple: “when X happens, emit event”.

You can add new triggers later without changing all your booking code; you only touch the notification worker.

1.4. Retry / backoff

What to do

Every notification send (email/SMS) is a job in a queue (e.g., a Supabase function + cron, or a lightweight queue).

Store jobs in a notification_jobs table:

id

template_id

business_id

recipient_email / recipient_phone

subject

body

channel

status (pending, in_progress, sent, failed, dead)

attempt_count

last_error

scheduled_at

Implement exponential backoff:

1st failure → retry in 5 minutes

2nd failure → retry in 15 minutes

3rd failure → mark as dead and stop

Ensure idempotency by using a composite key like (booking_id, trigger, channel) so you do not send duplicate messages if the same event is retried.

Why

Reliable enough for a SaaS; not over-engineered.

You get observability: you can show “failed notifications” in an internal debug menu if you ever need support tooling.

2. Availability Engine

Your constraints:

Availability is per service, per staff, configured in onboarding. 

frontend logistics

Customers see a calendar that shows per-staff slots with overlap (multiple staff free at the same time).

No staff logins; staff entries are just for scheduling & display.

2.1. Data model / rules

What to do

In Postgres (with RLS):

staff:

id

owner_id

name, role, color, active

services:

id

owner_id

category_id

name, duration_minutes, price_cents, etc.

staff_services (junction):

staff_id, service_id, owner_id

availability_rules:

id

owner_id

service_id

staff_id

weekday (0–6)

start_time (e.g., 09:00)

end_time (e.g., 17:00)

capacity (usually 1)

valid_from / valid_to (nullable; for seasonal changes)

blackouts:

id

owner_id

staff_id (nullable for whole business)

start_at, end_at

reason

All rows carry owner_id for RLS: each owner can only see their own records.

Why

This matches your onboarding UX very closely (service-by-staff rules).

You keep the logic simple: “Here is when this staff offers this service on this weekday”.

2.2. Slot generation strategy

What to do

Granularity: Use 15-minute increments internally.

Given:

business timezone (from onboarding),

service duration,

availability rules,

blackouts,

existing bookings,

generate slots for a given service + date:

For each staff that can perform that service (staff_services), load that staff’s availability_rules for the weekday.

For each rule:

Convert start_time / end_time into that day’s actual timestamps in the business timezone.

Walk in 15-minute steps, building candidate start times.

For each candidate start time:

Ensure it is after the lead time (e.g., now + 2 hours).

Ensure the end time (start + duration) is before the rule end_time.

Ensure it does not overlap any blackouts.

Ensure it does not overlap any existing bookings or held slots for that staff + service.

Return slots like:

[
  {
    "staff_id": "...",
    "staff_name": "...",
    "start": "2025-11-16T14:00:00-05:00",
    "end": "2025-11-16T14:30:00-05:00"
  },
  ...
]


Do this on the backend and send to the front-end for rendering in columns by staff (so overlapping availability is visually clear).

Lead time & max advance

Add configuration fields on the business:

min_lead_time_minutes (e.g., 120)

max_advance_days (e.g., 60)

At slot generation, filter out slots before now + min_lead_time_minutes and after today + max_advance_days.

Why

It keeps all availability math server-side.

You can change slot granularity or lead times without touching the frontend.

It cleanly supports your overlap requirement (multiple staff can show simultaneous slots).

2.3. Blackouts & exceptions

What to do

Blackouts are just time ranges that subtract from otherwise available ranges.

To handle exceptions (e.g., one-off working Sunday):

Either add explicit availability_rules for that date, or

Add an exceptions table if you need more nuance later.

For v1, you can get far with:

Weekly rules + blackouts.

“Closed days” = blackouts for the whole business (staff_id = null).

Why

It’s simple to implement: “generate from rules, then subtract blackouts”.

It lets owners block out vacations or closed days without reconfiguring all rules.

2.4. Caching strategy

What to do

Do not overcomplicate in v1.

Cache availability per service + date in memory/Redis for a short time (e.g., 30–60 seconds):

Key: avail:{owner_id}:{service_id}:{date}

Invalidate cache whenever:

a new booking is created/held for that day,

availability rules change,

blackouts change.

On the frontend, also cache the response with React Query so switching dates back and forth feels instant.

Why

Slot generation isn’t very heavy for a small number of staff/services.

Short caching reduces DB load without creating consistency headaches.

3. Preventing Double-Booking

This is the “locking vs optimistic” question.

Your world:

Only one owner user is making “money moves” (no staff logins).

Customers can be booking simultaneously, though.

You do not want two customers to end up with the same staff + time.

3.1. Pick: optimistic + DB uniqueness (recommended)

You could do heavyweight locks, but for your scope I would:

What to do

Database uniqueness constraint

On the bookings table, enforce that there cannot be more than one active booking (pending, confirmed, held) for the same staff + start time:

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_active_slot
ON bookings (staff_id, start_at)
WHERE status IN ('held', 'pending', 'confirmed');


Introduce a short “hold” status during checkout

When the customer chooses a slot and hits “continue to checkout”, you immediately create a booking row:

status = 'held'

holder_expires_at = now() + interval '5 minutes'

This insert is wrapped in a transaction that can fail on the uniqueness constraint:

If the insert succeeds → you own the slot for 5 minutes.

If it fails → tell the user “Sorry, this slot was just taken, choose another one.”

Expire holds

A background job runs every minute to:

UPDATE bookings
SET status = 'expired'
WHERE status = 'held'
  AND holder_expires_at < now();


Your availability query ignores expired status.

Finalize at checkout

After the card is saved via SetupIntent and you have the booking all set:

Keep it pending (card saved, no charge yet) OR

Move status = 'pending' and clear the hold expiry (not needed anymore).

The uniqueness constraint still prevents another booking with the same staff/time being created.

Why this is a good fit

It’s simple and plays nicely with Supabase/Postgres.

You don’t need application-level locks or Redis locks; the database guarantees uniqueness for you.

It aligns with your UX: if two people click the same slot around the same time, one will “win” and the other gets a friendly error.

3.2. Why not heavy locking?

You could:

Use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE on an availability table, or

Use Postgres advisory locks or Redis locks.

But:

That’s overkill given your scale and the simplicity of your domain.

A unique partial index and a “held” status already solve the problem in the most maintainable way.

4. How this respects your constraints

One business per user / one admin login

Every table carries owner_id.

RLS simply enforces owner_id = current_user_id.

There’s no concept of “switching businesses” anymore.

No staff logins

staff rows are just scheduling entities; there’s no password, no auth, no roles.

All admin actions (completing, no-show, refund) are done by the single owner account.

Customers don’t sign in

customers table: name, email, phone, stripe_customer_id.

They’re created on each booking; we only tie bookings and notifications to them.

Login goes straight to admin

As you already said, /login → /app/admin (for that owner’s single business).

No dashboard, no multi-tenant switching UI.

Past bookings but no “customer portal”

Admin has a Past Bookings page.

Customers don’t get an account or “history” page; they just see confirmation email/SMS and optionally a one-off confirmation page.

---------
Gift Cards and Policies and Compliance

0. Quick reality check on your constraints

Given your clarifications:

One owner account → one business (for v1).

Only the owner logs into admin (no staff logins; staff are just scheduling objects).

Customers never sign in — they just enter name/email/phone at checkout.

Login goes straight to admin for that business (no dashboard).

The admin “Past Bookings” page = money board that shows bookings + customer contact info and gives the owner four actions:

Completed

No-Show

Cancelled

Refund

Those are the only ways money moves; nothing charges at booking time.

All the gift card + policy design has to plug into that world.

1. Gift Cards — options, then my recommendation
1.1 The realistic options

Option A — “Real” stored-value gift cards only (amount-based)

A card has a starting balance (e.g. $100).

Every time it’s used, you deduct from the balance; if the booking is cheaper than the balance, you keep leftover balance.

Requires a ledger to track every debit/credit so you can show history and debug.

Option B — Simple coupon codes (percentage or fixed discount, one-off)

Each code is just: type = percent|fixed, value, and maybe max_uses.

No balance, so no ledger.

Once used, it's either used up or counts towards a max usage counter.

Easy to build; hard to represent as “gift card” in the real world.

Option C — Hybrid: stored-value + percentage codes both supported

You have:

Stored-value gift cards (amount) with ledger.

Percent discount codes that apply once per booking but don’t track balance.

A booking can apply one code of either type to keep UX simple.

1.2 What I think you should do

For Tithi v1, I’d go with Option C but with tight rules:

Support two code types under the same “gift code” feature:

type = 'amount' → real gift card with balance + ledger.

type = 'percent' → discount/“promo code”, one use per booking, no balance.

Allow only one code per booking (huge simplification).

Implement a ledger only for amount-type cards.

Reasoning:

You already promise “amount or percentage gift cards” in the UX copy; walking that back is annoying.

A ledger is not actually that hard and gives you a clean audit trail.

Limiting it to one code per booking keeps the money math sane and matches your simple money board design.

1.3 Schema I’d use

Table: gift_codes

id

business_id (or tenant_id – one per owner anyway)

code (string, unique per business)

type ('amount' | 'percent')

amount_cents (for amount type)

percent_off (for percent type)

max_uses (nullable; only relevant for percent codes)

current_uses (for percent codes)

initial_balance_cents (for amount type, mostly for display)

balance_cents (for amount type)

expires_at (nullable)

active (bool)

created_at, updated_at

Table: gift_code_ledger (only used for type='amount')

id

gift_code_id

booking_id (nullable for manual adjustments)

delta_cents (negative for redemption, positive for top-up / refund restore)

reason ('redeem' | 'refund_restore' | 'manual_adjust')

created_at

Booking fields (in bookings or booking_payments):

gift_code_id (nullable)

gift_code_type ('amount' | 'percent', cached)

gift_code_value_cents (for percent, store “how much was discounted”)

gift_code_redeemed_cents (for amount, portion of booking covered)

base_price_cents (price of service)

final_price_cents (what you will actually charge via money buttons)

This is enough to:

Show “You saved $X using code ABC123”.

Correctly calculate what to refund and whether to restore card balance.

1.4 Redemption rules (how checkout should behave)

At checkout:

Customer enters code.

Backend validates:

Code exists, active = true, expires_at not in the past.

For percent-type: current_uses < max_uses (if max_uses not null).

Compute discount:

Percent-type:

discount = round(base_price_cents * percent_off / 100)
final_price_cents = max(0, base_price_cents - discount)


Amount-type:

discount = min(base_price_cents, balance_cents)
final_price_cents = base_price_cents - discount


Return final_price_cents to frontend; show it clearly (“$100 – $25 gift = $75”).

Save these values on the booking (gift_code_id, gift_code_type, gift_code_redeemed_cents or gift_code_value_cents, final_price_cents).

Do NOT modify balance or usages yet.
You only set:

For percent codes: current_uses += 1 immediately or at money action; I’d do it at booking creation so you don't oversell promos.

For amount cards: hold the planned redemption in the booking but don’t touch balance until money actually moves.

Reasoning:
You promised “no payment yet at checkout” — only card on file. If a booking is canceled without any fee charged, no gift-card money should actually be consumed.

1.5 When money actually moves (how the money board ties in)

On the Past Bookings / money board, owner hits:

Completed

You create a PaymentIntent for final_price_cents (already includes gift card discount).

Amount-type: when charge succeeds:

Add ledger entry with delta_cents = -gift_code_redeemed_cents.

balance_cents -= gift_code_redeemed_cents.

Percent-type: nothing to do (no balance).

No-Show (fee)

Compute charge amount from policy (e.g. 50% of final_price_cents or a flat fee).

Gift cards do not automatically apply to no-show fees in v1 (to keep rules simple).
Reason: using someone’s gift card to pay for their penalty feels sketchy and complicates refunds.

So for v1: no gift card on no-show/cancel fees. Always charge card on file.

Cancelled (fee)

Same approach as No-Show: policy fee always billed to card, not gift card.

Refund

When the owner hits Refund:

Determine total refundable_amount_cents from the booking payments.

Decide how to split between:

Card money (what actually went via Stripe).

Gift card value (what we deducted from balance, if any).

Recommended v1 behavior:

Amount-type gift card:

If the booking was paid using a gift card and the owner refunds the booking:

Refund card money through Stripe.

Optionally restore gift balance: add ledger entry delta_cents = +gift_code_redeemed_cents, and bump balance_cents.

Add a simple toggle per business: “Refunds restore gift card balance? yes/no” (global setting).

Percent-type code:

Nothing to restore; refund is all via Stripe.

If the booking never had a captured payment, “Refund” is disabled or shows a tooltip “No payment to refund” — exactly how you described the no-op behavior you want.

2. Policies, consent logging, and basic compliance

The AI’s second concern is: “Exactly what do we log and keep for policies and compliance?”

2.1 What must be logged when a customer consents

At checkout, when they see your policies modal (cancellation, no-show, refund, cash payment) and tick “I agree”, capture:

For each booking:

policy_snapshot_text

Either a single JSON blob or separate fields:

cancellation_policy_text

no_show_policy_text

refund_policy_text

cash_payment_policy_text

policy_version or policy_hash

A hash (e.g. SHA-256) of the policy text so you can prove “this is exactly what was shown.”

consent_given (bool)

consent_at (timestamp, UTC)

consent_ip (string)

consent_user_agent (string)

consent_locale (optional, if you localize later)

You already plan a single scrollable modal plus a required checkbox; this just says, “when they click, write a record on the booking.”

From a schema perspective, easiest is to add these columns to bookings:

policy_hash

policy_snapshot_json

consent_at

consent_ip

consent_user_agent

Reasoning:

Every payment dispute boils down to: “what did the customer agree to at the time of booking?”

If you snapshot the policy and log consent metadata, you have a clean story to show Stripe or the business.

2.2 Where these policies live in admin

In the admin Policies step + edit screen:

You maintain current policies in a business_policies table with columns:

business_id

cancellation_policy_text

no_show_policy_text

no_show_fee_type ('flat'|'percent')

no_show_fee_value

cancellation_fee_type ('flat'|'percent')

cancellation_fee_value

refund_policy_text

cash_payment_policy_text

version (monotonic integer)

updated_at

When a new booking is created, you:

Pull current business_policies.

Compute policy_hash = hash(all texts + fee config).

Store policy_hash + the entire snapshot object into the booking.

This way:

Owner can change policies any time in admin.

Old bookings still keep the older snapshot so disputes are consistent.

2.3 Retention strategy (practical, not legal advice)

Minimum reasonable v1 plan:

Bookings + policy snapshots: keep for at least 5 years.

Gift card ledger: keep as long as gift card + bookings exist (helps debug).

Consent IP/user agent: kept with bookings (same 5-year window).

Implementation idea:

Even if a business “cancels” its subscription:

Immediately deprovision the subdomain and hide booking site.

Keep bookings + policy logs for X years in soft-deleted state; after that, hard delete.

You should 100% write in the admin (or ToS): “We retain booking + policy data for N years to support payment disputes,” and then later consult a lawyer to confirm N.

2.4 GDPR/PCI expectations (how to keep yourself out of trouble)

You can’t self-certify GDPR/PCI here, but you can design so you’re not doing dangerous things:

For PCI:

Never store raw card data (PAN, CVV) or screenshots of it.

Only store:

stripe_customer_id

payment_method_id

“brand, last4, expiry month/year” (non-sensitive, for display).

Use Stripe Elements / Payment Element on the frontend, with SetupIntents to store the card.

All money actions (Completed, No-Show, Cancelled, Refund) call your backend, which talks to Stripe using those IDs only.

For GDPR / privacy basics:

Treat customer PII as:

name

email

phone

Keep it in a customers table keyed by business.

Be ready to:

Export all their data for that business (CSV/JSON).

Delete or anonymize their data if asked (e.g. keep bookings but remove name, email, phone after a certain period).

Document retention:

E.g., “Customer data may be retained for up to 5 years to support financial record keeping and dispute resolution.”

Again: not legal advice — but designing your models with this in mind will make it much easier to harden later.

3. Concrete “do this next” checklist for Tithi

If you want something actionable for Cursor / Supabase / backend:

Lock in your scope:

One owner → one business.

Gift cards: one code per booking; support amount + percent types.

No gift card applied to no-show/cancellation fees in v1.

Add database pieces:

gift_codes + gift_code_ledger tables as above.

New booking fields:

base_price_cents, final_price_cents

gift_code_id, gift_code_type, gift_code_redeemed_cents, gift_code_value_cents

policy_hash, policy_snapshot_json, consent_at, consent_ip, consent_user_agent

business_policies table with versioning.

Wire up frontend flows you already designed:

On Policies step:

Save policies into business_policies.

On Checkout:

When the customer ticks “I agree,” send ip + userAgent from frontend to backend; backend:

Pull current policies, compute hash, store snapshot + consent info on booking.

When a gift code is entered, call a /gift-codes/preview endpoint that returns:

discount_cents

final_price_cents

type
Then show that and include it in booking creation.

Wire up money board actions:

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/complete:

Create PaymentIntent for final_price_cents.

If gift_code_type = 'amount' and charge succeeds, write ledger row and update balance.

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/no-show / cancel:

Charge policy fees without touching gift card balance.

POST /admin/bookings/{id}/refund:

If payment exists, issue Stripe refund.

For amount-type cards, if business’s “restore balance on refund” is true, write positive ledger entry & update balance.

Exposes policy + gift code info in admin UI:

Policies screen: current text + fee values; show a “Version X” badge.

Past Bookings side panel:

Show which code was used, how much it contributed, and policy snapshot (“Customer agreed to: ...”).

Gift Card tab:

Show current balance, ledger list, and a way to deactivate a code.

If you follow that, the AI’s complaints (“I can’t ship backend from just your frontend docs”) disappear, because you’ve now answered the two critical unknowns: how money from gift cards actually behaves and what exactly you log for policy consent and retention.
------------

Operations and Tooling and Environment and Deployment and Testing and Seeding
I’ll assume:

Frontend: Next.js (which you already built)

Backend/DB: Supabase Postgres + RLS, with Next.js route handlers as the BFF

1. Operations & tooling
1A. Background job framework & queue

What I recommend:

Use a simple “jobs” table in Postgres + one worker instead of a heavy queue system.

Let the worker be:

either a Next.js API route called by a cron service, or

a small separate worker script (Node or Python) that runs on your server and polls the jobs table.

Jobs table shape (simplified):

id

type ('reminder' | 'payment_followup' | 'subscription_check' | ...)

payload (JSON)

run_at (timestamp)

priority ('high' | 'medium' | 'low')

attempts

status ('pending' | 'processing' | 'done' | 'failed')

Queue priorities:

High: anything to do with money or time-sensitive UX

sending 24h / 1h reminders for appointments

charging no-show / cancellation fees if you ever automate that

subscription status checks if Stripe billing webhooks failed

Medium:

sending receipts / booking confirmation emails & SMS

handling Stripe webhooks that aren’t directly on the critical path

Low:

analytics aggregation (bookings per service, etc.)

cleaning old soft-hold slots

“daily digest” emails to owners (later)

This lines up nicely with your product mechanics: Stripe charges only when the owner hits Completed / No-show / Cancel / Refund in Past Bookings, not at checkout, so you don’t need super-complicated auth-expiry logic at first—most of the job load is notifications + minor cleanups. 

frontend logistics

1B. Cron jobs

Use a small set of cron-triggered endpoints instead of many little crons:

cron/reminders (runs every 5–10 minutes)

Finds bookings happening in the next 24h / 1h, enqueues reminder jobs.

cron/payments-health (every 10–15 minutes)

Looks for any payment jobs stuck in “processing” too long, marks as failed + alerts.

cron/subscription-health (daily)

Double-checks business subscription status vs Stripe (Active, Paused, Canceled) and updates business availability / subdomain if needed.

cron/cleanup (daily)

Clears expired soft slots, deletes very old temp data, etc.

In Supabase, you can:

Use scheduled edge functions or pg_cron to hit those endpoints, or

Use something like cron-job.org / GitHub Actions if you want to keep it super simple.

2. Observability (metrics, tracing, alerting)

You don’t need full-blown enterprise observability yet. You just need enough to answer:

“Are bookings working?”

“Are we charging people correctly?”

“Are reminders actually going out?”

2A. Metrics to track

Start with a tiny set of core metrics:

Bookings

bookings_created_per_day

bookings_completed_per_day

no_show_count_per_day

Payments

payment_success_count

payment_failure_count

total_gross_amount

total_platform_fees (1%) 

frontend logistics

Jobs

queued_jobs_by_type

jobs_failed_by_type

Notifications

notifications_sent_by_type (confirmation, reminder, no-show, refund, etc.)

notifications_failed_by_type

You can log these into:

a small metrics_daily table in Postgres (aggregated once per day by a cron), and/or

a SaaS like Plausible / Simple Analytics for public site views + funnels.

2B. Logging

Implement structured logs on the backend:

Every API request / important event should log:

request_id

user_id (owner) or null for public

business_id

booking_id (if relevant)

stripe_event_id (if it came from webhooks)

action: e.g. BOOKING_CREATED, BOOKING_COMPLETED, NO_SHOW_FEE_CHARGED

This can be:

just console.log(JSON.stringify({...})) with a log drain (Vercel, Supabase Logflare), plus

a small event_log table for owner-facing “activity” if you want.

2C. Alerts

Keep alerts very minimal:

If payment_failure_count spikes over some threshold in an hour → send you a Slack / email.

If jobs_failed_by_type for reminder or payment goes above N → alert.

If Stripe webhook handler starts throwing errors (e.g., > 5 failures in 10 minutes) → alert.

Tools: Sentry for errors + a simple status email/slack via a cron + query.

3. Environment & deployment
3A. Stack choice (for where you are right now)

Given what you’ve built and your goals, I’d stick to:

Frontend + BFF: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)

Backend data layer: Supabase Postgres + RLS

Payments: Stripe (Connect + Billing) wired exactly as in your spec: card saved at checkout, actual charge only on admin “money buttons.” 

frontend logistics

You do NOT need a completely separate backend service yet. Let Next.js route handlers / server actions be your “API” layer talking to Supabase.

3B. Repo layout

Keep it simple but future-proof:

tithi/
  apps/
    web/           # Next.js app (admin + booking + auth + landing)
    worker/        # optional later — small Node script for jobs
  packages/
    shared-types/  # Zod/TS schemas shared between frontend & routes
  .env.example
  docker-compose.dev.yml   # optional, for local Postgres/Redis


Right now you really just need apps/web. The worker folder can come later if you want a dedicated job runner instead of cron-hitting Next routes.

3C. Config management & secrets

All secrets go in env vars, never in git:

SUPABASE_URL

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (only on server / worker, never in browser)

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

NEXTAUTH_SECRET or equivalent if using auth libs

Use:

.env.local for dev

Vercel / Render / Fly dashboards for prod/stage env vars.

For Supabase, use:

anon key only in the browser,

service key only in server-side functions / workers for admin-level operations (like background jobs, notifications, Stripe webhooks).

3D. Local dev setup

Make it really straightforward:

cp .env.example .env.local and fill in dev Stripe keys + Supabase dev project keys.

npm install

npm run dev

npm run seed:dev (command that seeds demo data—see below)

If you ever decide to run Supabase locally:

use supabase start via CLI, and point your app at the local DB.

4. Testing & seeding
4A. What absolutely must be tested

You don’t need 100% coverage, but a few pieces have to be rock-solid:

Availability & slots

Given service duration + staff availability rules, do you generate the correct slots?

Do overlapping staff schedules render correctly? (Multiple staff free at same time, etc.)

Pricing & discounts

final_price = base_price – gift_card_amount_or_percent, clamped at ≥ 0

discount is exactly the same number that’s later charged when the owner hits Completed / No-show / Cancel.

“Money buttons” behavior

Completed → creates a PaymentIntent with amount = final_price, charges card-on-file.

No-show / Cancel → charge correct policy fee (flat or percent; 0 allowed).

Refund → only allowed if a charge exists; otherwise no-op with explanation.

Tenant isolation / RLS

For a given business_id (tenant), you can only read/write its data.

Tests should confirm you cannot query other tenants’ bookings, staff, services, etc., even if you try.

Notification template placeholder resolution

${customer.name}, ${service.name}, ${booking.date}, etc. are filled correctly for a mock booking. 

frontend logistics

Concrete: use Vitest/Jest for pure functions (price calc, slot generation) and Playwright or Cypress for one or two end-to-end flows (public booking → admin completes → payment + notification fired).

4B. Seed data / fixtures

You want dev to feel like a real tenant using Tithi.

Seed script should create:

1 demo owner user (email/password you know).

1 demo business (since you’re doing 1 owner ↔ 1 business now).

Business profile fully filled:

branding, logos, colors

2–3 categories (e.g., Haircut, Color, Treatment)

5–8 services with duration, price, and instructions

2–3 team members (for availability only, no logins).

Availability:

Each service linked to one or more staff with sane weekly hours so the calendar looks alive.

1–2 notification templates per trigger (confirmation + 24h reminder).

2–3 policies (cancellation, no-show fee, refund policy text).

2 gift cards (one flat $$, one % discount).

10+ bookings across statuses:

a few pending

some with Completed (charged)

one No-show (with fee charged)

one Cancelled (with/without fee)

one Refunded

This lets you, on a fresh dev environment:

Hit the booking flow like a real customer.

Log into admin, see Past Bookings filled with realistic cards.

Click money buttons and verify everything visually.

Fixtures for tests can reuse that same shape but inline: small JSON/TS objects representing a booking, service, policies, etc., so unit tests aren’t tied to the DB.

5. How this all respects your current constraints

1 user → 1 business:
Add a DB constraint like UNIQUE (owner_user_id) on the businesses table. Everything in admin is scoped to that business; no business-switcher in the UI for now, even though the data model can support it later.

Only owner can log in:
Don’t even create auth rows for staff. They are purely scheduling entities.

Login goes straight to admin:
After login, query “their business,” and redirect to /app/b/{businessId}/admin. No dashboard.

Customers never sign in:
Public booking flow just writes a customers row + bookings row and saves a Stripe customer/payment method behind the scenes; there is no customer auth surface.

Past orders for customers not needed (only admin past bookings):
You already have this with the Past Bookings money-board concept—the data is only surfaced in admin, not customer-facing.

Everything above is aimed at V1 that ships, not a giant infrastructure fantasy. You get:

simple jobs & crons

enough observability to know when stuff breaks

a clean, Next.js + Supabase stack that matches what you’ve already started

focused tests on the parts of Tithi that can actually hurt you (money, time slots, tenant isolation)
